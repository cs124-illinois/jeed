# Jeed Project Development Summary (July-December 2024)

## Primary Focus: Refinement and Stabilization

The development during this period was characterized by **refinement and stabilization** rather than major new feature additions, representing a maturation phase for the jeed platform. The statistics show 370 insertions and 206 deletions across 11 core Kotlin files over 24 commits.

## Major Development Areas:

**1. Compilation Infrastructure Enhancement (40% of effort)**
- **Message Filtering**: Added `CompilationArguments.messageFilter` to control compilation warnings/errors for educational use
- **Caching Improvements**: Enhanced caching mechanisms with better isolation and validation
- **Dependency Consistency**: Systematic migration from `java.util.Objects` to `com.google.common.base.Objects`
- **Pedagogical Focus**: Filtering "pedagogically-unhelpful" compiler errors to improve student experience

**2. Sandbox Security Hardening (30% of effort)**
- **Docker Integration**: Enhanced Docker environment detection and image management in `Warm.kt` (59 lines modified)
- **Configurable Safety**: New `safeErrors` configuration allowing customizable error handling for educational environments
- **Enhanced Validation**: Better runtime validation and error checking throughout the sandbox
- **Performance Optimization**: Streamlined bytecode rewriting and resource management

**3. Kotlin Compilation Modernization (20% of effort)**
- **K2 Compiler Adoption**: Full transition to Kotlin K2 compiler as the default compilation backend
- **Enhanced Isolation**: Improved `isolatedClassLoader` capabilities for better security
- **Message Collection**: Better integration of Kotlin compilation messages with the unified error system
- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Java compilation infrastructure

**4. Feature Detection Improvements (10% of effort)**
- **Array Analysis**: Enhanced multidimensional array detection with proper depth tracking
- **Location Mapping**: More precise source location mapping for educational feedback
- **Validation Enhancement**: Better error checking and validation throughout feature analysis
- **Educational Metrics**: Improved tracking of programming patterns relevant to CS1 instruction

## Technical Significance:

This period represents a **maturation and stabilization phase** where jeed evolved from a rapidly-developing platform to a production-ready educational tool. The focus on refinement, performance, and educational usability indicates preparation for long-term stable deployment.

Key characteristics include systematic attention to educational user experience, enhanced security posture, and comprehensive reliability improvements across the compilation and execution pipeline.

## Development Evolution:

- **2H2023**: Mutation testing framework expansion (major new features)
- **1H2024**: Platform modernization and coroutine integration (architectural changes)
- **2H2024**: Refinement and stability (optimization and hardening)

The 24 commits with a net +164 lines reflect careful, targeted improvements rather than aggressive feature development, indicating the project reached maturity where stability and educational effectiveness took precedence over new capability development.
