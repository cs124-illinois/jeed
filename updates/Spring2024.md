# Jeed Project Development Summary (January-June 2024)

## Primary Focus: Platform Modernization and Capability Expansion

The development during this period shifted from the previous focus on mutation testing to **platform modernization and capability expansion**, emphasizing support for modern Kotlin features and mixed-language development. The statistics show 1,322 insertions and 966 deletions across 28 core Kotlin files over 85 commits.

## Major Development Areas:

**1. Mixed Java/Kotlin Compilation Support (25% of effort)**
- **"Mompile" Implementation**: Added `Mompile.kt` (44 new lines) enabling compilation of projects containing both Java and Kotlin source files
- **Sequential Compilation**: Kotlin files compiled first, then Java with Kotlin-generated classes in classpath
- **Educational Impact**: Enables more complex educational projects using multiple JVM languages

**2. Kotlin Coroutine Integration (30% of effort)**
- **Coroutine Lifecycle Management**: New `CoroutineIntegration.kt` (82 new lines) for detecting active coroutine tasks
- **Enhanced Execution Control**: Automatic timeout extensions for coroutine-using code (minimum 600ms with 4+ extra threads)
- **Modern Kotlin Support**: Detection of active tasks via reflection on `DefaultExecutor` and `CoroutineScheduler`
- **Critical Feature**: Essential for supporting contemporary Kotlin programming patterns in CS courses

**3. Sandbox Infrastructure Overhaul (35% of effort)**
- **Major Rework**: `Sandbox.kt` received 745 lines of comprehensive changes
- **Dynamic Control**: New `SandboxControl` interface for runtime timeout management
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved classloader isolation and method blacklisting
- **Reliability**: Robust handling across JVM versions and platform differences

**4. JSON Serialization Modernization (10% of effort)**
- **Adapter Refactoring**: Extensive rework of `moshi/Adapters.kt` (204 lines modified)
- **API Consistency**: Standardized data transfer objects for server components
- **Maintainability**: Better separation between core logic and serialization

## Technical Significance:

This period represents a **strategic shift from assessment tools to comprehensive platform capabilities**. The focus moved from mutation testing enhancements to fundamental infrastructure improvements that support modern programming paradigms.

Key achievements include multi-language compilation support, robust coroutine handling, and a modernized execution sandbox - all critical for advanced computer science education at scale.

## Development Focus Comparison:

- **Previous Period (2H2023)**: 60% mutation testing, 25% language support, 15% tooling
- **First Half 2024**: 60% infrastructure/platform, 25% language support, 15% maintenance

The evolution from educational assessment tools toward a production-ready compilation and execution platform suitable for contemporary CS curriculum requirements.
