# Jeed Project Development Summary (June-December 2023)

## Primary Focus: Mutation Testing Framework Expansion

The development during this period was heavily concentrated on **enhancing and expanding the mutation testing capabilities**, which is core to jeed's educational mission for CS 124. The statistics show 1,315 insertions and 417 deletions across 25 core Kotlin files.

## Major Development Areas:

**1. Mutation Testing Infrastructure (60% of effort)**
- **New Mutation Types**: Added numerous sophisticated mutation operators including `NumberLiteralTrim`, `StringLiteralTrim`, `AddBreak`, `ModifyArrayLiteral`, and `ChangeLengthAndSize`
- **Safety Enhancements**: Implemented division-by-zero detection and prevention logic to avoid unsafe mutations that could crash student code
- **Intelligence Improvements**: Enhanced context-aware mutation application with better negative number handling and mutation applicability logic

**2. Language Support Enhancement (25% of effort)**
- **Dual Language Support**: Parallel improvements to both `JavaMutation.kt` (234 lines changed) and `KotlinMutation.kt` (268 lines changed) with better AST traversal and mutation detection
- **Parser Infrastructure**: Enhanced ANTLR4-based parsing with improved grammar handling and error recovery

**3. Code Quality and Analysis Tools (15% of effort)**
- **KtLint Integration**: Major rework of `KtLint.kt` (276 lines) with thread-safety improvements and performance optimizations
- **Complexity Analysis**: Enhancements to both Java and Kotlin complexity analysis engines
- **Feature Detection**: Improved feature analysis capabilities for educational code assessment

## Technical Significance:

This period represents a **maturation phase** where jeed evolved from a basic mutation framework to a sophisticated, production-ready educational tool. The emphasis on safety, comprehensiveness, and reliability indicates preparation for large-scale deployment in CS 124's automated assessment system.

The development focused on making mutation testing both more powerful (with new mutation types) and safer (with division-by-zero prevention), while maintaining the dual Java/Kotlin support essential for the educational environment.
